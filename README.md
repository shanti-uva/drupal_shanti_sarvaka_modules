drupal_shanti_sarvaka_modules
=============================
This is a suite of modules for integrating with the Drupal Shanti Sarvaka theme. It contains

# explore_menu: a module that creates a block for placing in the top bar that creates the link and drop down explore menu. (Note: the final links need to be added to this module.)
# user_prefs: a module for adding the user preference form to the multi-level menu in the top bar. It saves the settings on a user by user basis and makes them available in the Drupal.settings JS object. (Note: Need to add PHP api functions to access the settings via PHP.)

Combined into a single repo so that they can be added en-masse to sites using the Shanti Sarvaka Theme (https://github.com/shanti-uva/drupal_shanti_sarvaka_theme).
